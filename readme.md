# Get quacked!

**A retro-style game built with Phaser 3 and Firebase.**

Take on the role of a fearless duck seeking revenge against hunters. Blast away at the hunters closing in on you and use your shield of eggs to protect yourself. But don't let your guard down—these hunters will stop at nothing to take you out! Can you help the duck get the ultimate revenge?
